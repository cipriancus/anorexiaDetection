<h2>Description</h2>

The challenge consists in performing a task on early risk detection of depression. The challenge consists of sequentially processing pieces of evidence and detect early traces of depression as soon as possible. The task is mainly concerned about evaluating Text Mining solutions and, thus, it concentrates on texts written in Social Media. Texts should be processed in the order they were created. In this way, systems that effectively perform this task could be applied to sequentially monitor user interactions in blogs, social networks, or other types of online media.
