<h2>Description</h2>

This is a new task in 2019. The task consists of estimating the level of depression from a thread of user submissions. 
For each user, the participants will be given a history of postings and the participants will have to fill a standard depression questionnaire (based on the evidence found in the history of postings).

The questionnaires are defined from Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), which assesses the presence of feelings like sadness, pessimism, loss of energy, etc.
